## Motivation
Growing up in a small remote town, board games and cards were a staple activity for family night. One of the few games we owned was Connect 4, and while I was not great at winning against my family members, this game instilled life long memories. Now that I am an uncle to a handful of neices and nephew, I thought that I could help instill fun memories through this app.
